DEPRECATED: OCR Processor - No longer used.

This module has been deprecated as the system now uses direct AI image analysis
with Qwen3-vl-plus instead of OCR preprocessing. Images are sent directly to
the AI model for analysis without text extraction.

The OCR processor was previously used with PaddleOCR for Chinese text recognition,
but has been replaced by the more advanced multimodal AI approach.

# This file is kept for reference but is no longer used in the application.
# All image processing now happens directly in ai_analyzer.py
